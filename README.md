# specification-template

This specification is based on the [Trust Over IP Specification Template](https://github.com/trustoverip/specification-template).

The spec is written using [SpecUp](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up) which is maintained by the Decentralized Identity Foundation. 


To browse the spec, see the [rendering on GitHub pages](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/). To contribute to the spec, submit PRs that modify the .md files (in the `./spec` folder) that are used to generate the .html files in this folder.

Before submitting a PR, please see the [Editing The Spec](./EditingTheSpec.md) document for guidance on generating the specification locally for review.
