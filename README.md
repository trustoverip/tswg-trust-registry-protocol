# specification-template

A template for `ToIP` specifications [specification-template](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes).

The spec is written in W3C's [respec](https://dev.w3.org/2008/video/mediaann/ReSpec.js/documentation.html) format using DIF's [Spec-Up Tool](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/spec-up).
To browse the spec, see the [rendering on GitHub pages](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html). To contribute to the spec, submit PRs that modify the .md files that are used to generate the .html files in this folder.

Before submitting a PR, please see the [Editing The Spec](./EditingTheSpec.md) document for guidance on generating the specification locally for review.
