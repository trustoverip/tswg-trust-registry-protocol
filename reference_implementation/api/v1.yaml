    # Trust Registry capabilities
    * Allow querying for critical items in a digital trust ecosystem:
    Entities, Registries, and Resources that are required to operate
    in the ecosysystem.
    # Registry of Registries (RoR) capabilities.
    RoR capabilities include:
      * Listing Registries that are known (to the registry being queried).
      * list the acknowledged trust registries that the RoR recognizes and what
    that may mean in the context of a particular governance framework.
