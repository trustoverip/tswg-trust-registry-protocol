## Related Specifications

The Trust Registry Query Language (TRQL, pronounced “turkle”) is a companion specification to TRQP, developed to provide a standardized language for expressing queries against trust registries. TRQL was established by the Trust Registry Task Force (TRTF) to enable rapid evolution of query capabilities while keeping the TRQP specification stable. TRQL defines the vocabulary, syntax, and semantics for querying authority, recognition, delegation, and metadata statements in TRQP-compliant registries. It supports queries for authorizations, recognitions, delegated authorities, descriptions, and verifiable credential assertions, using structured strings and URI-references to ensure interoperability across ecosystems.

For details on the Trust Registry Query Language (TRQL), which defines the query syntax and semantics used by TRQP, see the [TRQL specification](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/149749777/TRQL+Trust+Registry+Query+Language).
