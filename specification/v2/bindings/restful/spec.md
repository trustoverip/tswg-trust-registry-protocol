## Trust Registry Query Protocol RESTful Binding
_this section is normative_

RESTful TRQP Bindings specification that implements the core specification. 

The following [OpenAPI](./swagger.yaml) Document describes the RESTful endpoints that are required for the TRQP RESTful binding. 

* The `/metadata` endpoint is aligned to the MetadataQuery.
* The `/registries/{ecosystem_id}/recognition` maps to the RecognitionQuery. 
* The `/entities/{entity_id}/authorization` maps to the AuthorizationQuery. 

### HTTP Error Code Mapping
_This section is normative_

The following mapping of error codes to HTTP Status is provided for http-based implementations:

| Return Code            | Return Message          | HTTP Status | HTTP Reason             | 
| -----------            | --------------          | ----------- | -----------             |
| `statuscode`           | `message`               |             |                         |
| TRQP-0                 | success                 | 200         | OK                      |
| TRQP-100               | error                   | 500         | Internal Server Error   |
| TRQP-200               | notfound                | 404         | Not Found               |
| TRQP-300               | unauthorized            | 401         | Not Authorized          |
| TRQP-400               | invalidrequest          | 400         | Invalid request         |

**Additional Information:**

* Error Codes and further detail are represented using [Problem Details described in rfc7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807).
* Authorization and Recognition Queries both take timestamps as a required parameter to resolve.
* Time parameters are in the form [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) and MUST be sent in UTC time. 
* If `jws` field in response is provided, verifiers are recommended to use that to verify the response payload controller.

Security considerations are left to the implementation profile to describe. 
Identifier requirements are left to the implementation profile to describe. 
Resolution paths are left to the implementation profile to describe.
