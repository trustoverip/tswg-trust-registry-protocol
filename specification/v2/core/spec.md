## Scope
_This section is informative._

Figure 1 illustrates the four primary components involved with TRQP architecture.

![TRQP primary components](images/trqp_components.png)

**Figure 1:** The primary components involved in TRQP architecture.

The scope of this specification is limited to the TRQP protocol operating between TRQP consumers and TRQP endpoints representing addressable TRQP trust registries. The following are out-of-scope:

* **Systems of record**. This specification casts no requirements on how the system of record is designed or deployed. Also, because TRQP is read-only, this specification does not address create, update, or delete operations for the system of record.
* **TRQP bridges**. If the system of record is not a native TRQP trust registry, a TRQP bridge is needed to transform a TRQP query into the query format supported by the system of record. Seperate specifications may be published for popular TRQP bridges, however they are out-of-scope for this specification.

## High-Level Architecture 

*This section is informative.*

In TRQP architecture, there are two primary roles involved with a TRQP-compliant
trust registry:

1. The ecosystem governing authority role (section 4.1).  
2. The trust registry operator role (section 4.2).

Both roles may be played by the same entity or by separate entities. Figure 2 is
a diagram of the case where the ecosystem governing authority is also the trust
registry operator. 


![images/authority_model_single_operator.png](images/authority_model_single_operator.png)

*Figure 2: Case \#1, where an ecosystem governing authority operates its own trust registry*

Figure 3 is a diagram of the case where the roles are played by different
entities, i.e., the ecosystem governing authority delegates operation of the
trust registry to an independent trust registry operator.

### Ecosystem Governing Authority 

The ecosystem governing authority is the entity responsible for governance of
the ecosystem and for publishing its authority statements. It may take any legal
form or may not be a formal legal entity at all. The only requirement is that
the ecosystem governing authority be recognized by the stakeholders in the
ecosystem for the purposes of its governance. 

From a TRQP architecture standpoint, the ecosystem governing authority is
responsible for:

* Publishing the ecosystem governance framework.  
* Controlling the ecosystem ID.  
* Publishing the ecosystem’s authority statements to one or more trust
  registries.

If the ecosystem governing authority chooses to operate its own trust
registr(ies), it is also responsible for the functions in section 4.2. If not,
the ecosystem governing authority is responsible for delegating these
responsibilities to a trust registry operator and communicating that delegation
pathway to any potential TRQP consumers. This should include publishing a
delegation statement to the trust registry (section 6.4).

::: note
 If ecosystem governing authority contracts with a service provider to manage
 the physical operation of a trust registry but that service provider: a) does
 not control their own cryptographic keys independently from those of the
 ecosystem governing authority, and b) does not take on any other
 responsibilities of an administering authority, then the ecosystem governing
 authority is still serving in the role of trust registry operator.
:::

### Trust Registry Operator

As described above, the role of a trust registry operator can be performed
directly by an ecosystem governing authority or may be delegated to an
independent trust registry operator who specializes in this function. In the
latter case, from a ToIP governance architecture perspective, the trust registry
operator is serving as an [administering authority](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:administering-body).

::: note
An independent trust registry operator may serve multiple ecosystem
governing authorities from the same trust registry because the authority
statements from each authority are logically independent.
:::

In all cases, the trust registry operator is responsible for:

* Controlling the trust registry ID.  
* Hosting the trust registry’s TRQP endpoints.  
* Managing the infrastructure to read and write to the registry.  
* Security, privacy, scalability, operating integrity, and availability of the trust registry.

If a trust registry operator is serving in an administering authority role, it is also responsible for:

* Its own cryptographic key management.  
* Publishing its own authority statements (as shown in figure 3), including:  
  * Delegation statements asserting its `delegated-by` relationship to each ecosystem governing authority the trust registry serves (section 6.3).  
  * Description statements asserting authoritative metadata about the trust registry (section 6.4).

### Ecosystem Governance Framework

Just as an ecosystem governing authority may take any form, so may the policies governing the ecosystem. For the purposes of this specification, the collection of these policies (whether human-readable and/or machine-readable) is called the [ecosystem governance framework](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:ecosystem-governance-framework).

To facilitate [trust decisions](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:trust-decision) by its stakeholders—or by any other relying party—the ecosystem governing authority is responsible for publishing the ecosystem governance framework. Although they are not normative requirements of this specification, the following recommendations apply:

1. The ecosystem governance framework should be published using a [verifiable identifier](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:verifiable-identifier) so its authenticity can be verified.  
2. The ecosystem governance framework ID should be discoverable via the ecosystem ID (section 5.1).  
3. The ecosystem governance framework should follow the recommendations of the [ToIP Governance Architecture Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf) and [ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf).

## Identifiers

*This section is normative.*

Interoperability of TRQP across decentralized digital trust ecosystems depends on globally unique identifiers in the same way interoperability of the Internet depends on IP addresses and DNS names.

The following requirements apply to all identifiers defining in this section:

1. The identifier MUST be represented as a single string conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) \[normative reference\].  
2. It is RECOMMENDED to use a [verifiable identifier](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:verifiable-identifier) such as a W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID), a KERI autonomic identifier (AID), or an HTTPS URL so their authenticity can be verified by any relying party.

For additional assurance, it is RECOMMENDED to use multi-anchoring of identifiers as defined by the IETF [High Assurance DIDs using DNS specification](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-carter-high-assurance-dids-with-dns-03.html) \[normative reference\] or the work of the ToIP [High Assurance Verifiable Identifiers Task Force](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/32473104/High+Assurance+VID+Task+Force+HAVID?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiMWJkOTU4MjI5NTdhNGU0ZTlhMmI3MGRlNWYwNmVmMGQiLCJwIjoiYyJ9) \[informative reference\].

### Ecosystem IDs

1. A TRQP-compliant digital trust ecosystem as a logical governance entity MUST have a globally unique identifier (the “ecosystem ID”).  
2. The domain name records, cryptographic keys, or other controls for the ecosystem ID MUST be controlled by the ecosystem governing authority.  
3. The ecosystem ID MUST:
   - Be used as an authority ID in TRQP authority statements for which the ecosystem governing authority is the authority.
   - Enable discoverability of the Ecosystem Governance Framework. 
   - Enable discoverability of the authorized trust registries serving that ecosystem. 

### Trust Registry IDs

1. A trust registry MUST have a globally unique identifier (the “trust registry ID”).  
2. The domain name records, cryptographic keys, or other controls for the trust registry ID MUST be controlled by one of the following:  
   1. The ecosystem governing authority, or  
   2. An independent trust registry operator delegated by the ecosystem governing authority.  
3. The trust registry ID MUST be used as an authority ID in TRQP authority statements for which the trust registry operator is the authority.
4. The trust regsitry ID MUST enable discoverability of the TRQP endpoints.

### Authority IDs

1. An authority ID MUST be the identifier of the controlling party for an authority statement.  
2. An authority ID MAY be either an ecosystem ID or a trust registry ID.  
3. All TRQP-compliant authority statements MUST be asserted by an authority ID.

### Entity IDs

1. An entity ID MUST be the identifier of the entity that is the target of the authority statement.  
2. For a recognition statement (section 6.3) or a delegation statement (section 6.4), the entity ID MUST be an authority ID.  
3. For an authorization statement about a [governed party](https://glossary.trustoverip.org/#term:governed-party) (section 6.2), the entity ID MUST be unique in the scope of the ecosystem. It is NOT REQUIRED for the entity ID to be globally unique.
