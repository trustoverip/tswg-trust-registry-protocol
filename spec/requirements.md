### Trust Registry Service Property [TRSP-*] 

The [[xref: TOIP, DID document]] for the **DID** that identifies an **EGF** compliant with this specification MUST include a service property that meets the **requirements** in section 5.4 of [[spec-norm:DID-CORE]] plus the following additional **requirements**:

[[ref: Registered entities]] MUST indicate which registries they are part of. 
* [TRSP-3] Registered entities MUST indicate the [[ref: primary trust registry]]] for a particular [[ref: authorization]].



#### Service Profile Recommendation

_the following recommendation is non-normative_


It is recommended that the service leverage the [Service Profile
Specification](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-service-profile/blob/main/spec.md).
Trust Over IP hosts a [Service Profile]() with the following pointer: 

```json
{
  "integrity": "<>",
  "profile": "<>"
  "uri": "<your service endpoint uri here>"
}
```

By implementing service profiles, it enables easier interoperability and
discovery of service capabilities for the trust registry being implemented.

### Trust Registry Protocol [TRP-*]

The authoritative technical specifications for the API calls in the ToIP Trust Registry Protocol V1 are specified in Appendix A (OpenAPI YAML file). This section contains a textual description of the **requirements**.

**Trust registries** implementing this protocol:

* [TRP-1] MUST maintain the service implementing this protocol at the HTTPS URI specified in the _[Trust Registry Service Property](#trust-registry-service-property)_ section.
* [TRP-2] The system SHOULD support queries that are at a point in time in the past. 
  * [TRP-2-1] The parameter for the point in time must be named `queryTime`.
  * [TRP-2-2] The datetime value provided MUST be formatted per [[spec-norm:RFC3339]] using the UTC (i.e. Z for Zulu) zero offset (e.g. "2018-03-20T09:12:28Z". 
  * [TRP-2-3] If the system does not support non-current data, and the the `queryTime` parameter is present, the system MUST NOT return entity data and must se http error code 405 (Method not allowed).
  
* [TRP-3] MUST return responses to queries for the **status value** of a **registry entry** that satisfies one or more of the following sets of query parameters:

    - [TRP-3-1] **Entity Authorization**: Given the `entityDID`, and `authorization` return the status of that registered entity, MUST return exactly one of the following **status values** for a **registry entry** satisfying the query parameters:
        - `Not Found` + http code 404 - entry not found.
        - `Current` + http code 200 - authorization for the registered entity is current as of the time of query, or as of the time requested.
        - `Expired` + http code 200 - authorization has expired (e.g. not renewed after the previous valid registration period)
        - `Terminated` + http code 200 - authorization was terminated (e.g. voluntary termination by the **registered entity**)
        - `Revoked` + http code 200 - authorization was revoked (e.g. involuntary termination by the **governing authority**) 
    - [TRP-3-2] **Entity Authorizations**: Given only the `entityDID` the system SHOULD return the array of Authorization objects for the entity identified by `entityDID`. 
    - ii. [TRP-3-2] **Recognized Registry:** Given the entityDID the system SHOULD return the list of [[def:trust registries]] that the entity has indicated it is registered in. 
        - [TRP-3-2-1] The system MUST NOT return more than one trust registry in the array designated as a [[def: primary registry]].

::: TODO: 
  Align VID or DID terminology.
:::

[TRP-4] MUST return responses using the data model specified in the OpenAPI Specification . 

[TRP-5] For queries returning a **status value** other than `Not Found`, the response MUST return the following values:
  - [TRP-5-1] The system must return the parameter values exactly as supplied in the query (so responses can be stateless).
  - [TRP-5-2] The system must return the **status value** for the entity (per TRP-3-1).
  - [TRP-5-3] The system must return exactly two **datetime values** conforming to the following requirements:
        - [TRP-5-3-1]The value labels MUST be:
            - i. `AuthorizationStartDate`
            - ii. `AuthorizationEndDate`
        - [TRP-5-3-2] The datetime values MUST be formatted to comply with [[spec-norm:RFC3339]] in the UTC/Z time zone with no offset.
        - [TRP-5-3-3] The `AuthorizationStartDate` MUST be the date that the **registered entity** authorization began.
        - [TRP-5-3-4] The `AuthorizationEndDate` MUST be either:
            - [TRP-5-3-4-1] `Null` for an entry whose **status value** is `Current` at the time of the query.
            - [TRP-5-3-4-2] A specific datetime value if the **registered entity** **status value** is `Expired`, `Terminated` or `Revoked.`
        - [TRP-5-3-5] If a **registered entity** has multiple entries in the system (representing an authorization history), the value that is active at the time indicated must be returned:
          - [TRP-5-3-5-1] when no `queryTime` value is provided the value that is active at time of the query MUST be returned.
          - [TRP-5-3-5-2] when a `queryTime` parameter is provided the entry that is active at that time (i.e. indicted by `queryTime`) MUST be returned. 

### Anti-Requirements

[AR-1] SHALL NOT support query operations for the history of a [[ref: registered entity]].   
        
[AR-2] SHALL NOT include support for a DIDComm interface, only a RESTful (i.e. OpenAPI Specification) interface. When a repeatable **trust task** specification approach is created, a DIDComm/**trust task** approach should be considered as a work effort.

[AR-3]]SHALL NOT support automated rules processing in the protocol. A rules engine can certainly use the protocol.


[AR-4] Anything other than read-only operations. The TRP is a read-only (RETRIEVE in the CRUD sense) protocol.
